This is the game which we all might have played in our childhood. Now we will be digitising it in the app. You should be as creative as you can in the design(UI/UX/animations). 

Please note that it will be a serious programming round, and all of the subsequent ones will also be. So, candidate must follow all the rules.

2. You will get 100+ images of animals.
3. No image should be displayed for more than 2 seconds.
4. No two images can have the same time duration of display.
5. You can decide rounds and number of players by yourself.
6. No submissions/commits after 6.30PM.
