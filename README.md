## Dussehra Hackathon

### 24th Oct 2020 | CHIDIYA UDD | 10 a.m. - 4p.m. 

This is the game which we all might have played in our childhood. Now we will be digitising it in the app. You should be as creative as you can in the design(UI/UX/animations). 

Please note that it will be a SERIOUS hackathon, and all of the subsequent ones will also be. So, participation is MANDATORY and no deployments or deliveries of your respective projects will be done tomorrow.

### Hackathon Guidelines
1. Use [this github repo](https://github.com/bhar4t/chidiya-udd.git) to fork and submit your app and add [@divich](https://github.com/divich/) and [@bhar4t](https://github.com/bhar4t/) as collaborators.
2. You will get 100+ images of animals.
3. No image should be displayed for more than 2 seconds.
4. No two images can have the same time duration of display.
5. You can decide rounds and number of players by yourself.
6. No submissions/commits after 4 p.m.
7. Design will be given the same priority as the game logic.
8. Rankings will be decided based on the design, game logic, UX.
9. Deployment of your app is expected on firebase.
10. A google sheet will be shared where you will enter the details of your app.
